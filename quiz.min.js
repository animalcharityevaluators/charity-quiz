While other organizations are also engaged in promising work in Brazil, SVB has the advantage of being a local group as opposed to a branch of an international organization. We think this factor could give them more credibility and enable them to better influence public opinion through their outreach. Given their focus on effectiveness and their ability to assess areas of success and failure, we think that donors who are interested in bringing about large-scale change for animals in Brazil should consider donating to SVB.',B.links={donation:"https://www.svb.org.br/filiacao",review:"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/sociedade-vegetariana-brasileira-svb",logo:"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SVB-logo-charity-quiz-2020.png",square_logo:"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/svb-stacked@2x-315x315@2x.jpg",website:"https://www.svb.org.br/"};const E=new x("Sinergia Animal",n);E.criteria={[a]:new C(i,h),"Cost of Expansion Plans":new C(o,h),"Track Record":new C(o,h),"Cost-Effectiveness":new C(s,h),"Response to Success and Failure":new C(s,h),"Leadership and Strategic Vision":new C(s,h),"Culture and Structure":new C(s,h)},E.interventions={"Online and Media Outreach":new S({[d]:1}),"Corporate Outreach":new S({"Influencing Industry":4}),Investigations:new S({[d]:1})},E.applyNeglectedCountryBonus(.25),E.description='<a href="https://www.sinergiaanimal.org/">Sinergia Animal</a> is a new organization founded in Brazil in October 2017 and operating in four Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Argentina). They work to reduce animal suffering and to decrease the consumption of animal products, with the long-term goal of ending animal exploitation altogether. Sinergia Animal plans to expand further in the Global South, focusing especially on countries where major international animal advocacy organizations are not currently working. They aim to work as pioneers, paving the way for other organizations to expand their operations. Sinergia Animal promotes a range of dietary changes including reductionism, flexitarianism, vegetarianism, and veganism. Their goal is to work towards a paradigm shift in global consumption patterns. They also engage in corporate outreach—at this stage, their campaigns focus on phasing out the use of cages to confine egg-laying hens and pregnant sows.',E.why_recommended="Sinergia operates in Latin America, where the animal advocacy movement is relatively smaller than in the U.S., and the marginal impact of additional work may be high. Rather than starting from scratch, they are learning from the successes of corporate campaigns in the U.S. and applying the same strategies in more neglected countries. They seem to have strong leadership and a clear strategy based on maximizing the effectiveness of their
