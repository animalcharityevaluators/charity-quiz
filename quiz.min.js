Albert Schweitzer Foundation (ASF) was founded in 2000. ASF primarily works in Germany, though they have a team in Poland as well. ASF works as a nonprofit (rather than making grants like a typical foundation). They work to improve animal welfare standards through their corporate outreach, corporate campaigns, and legal work. They also work with companies (distributors, producers, and restaurants) to promote plant-based alternatives to animal products. In addition, ASF works to build the capacity of the movement by organizing workshops and training sessions.",J.short_description="The Albert Schweitzer Foundation (ASF) works to improve animal welfare standards through their corporate outreach, corporate campaigns, and legal work. They operate primarily in Germany and have strong, impactful programs and a strategic approach. We believe that ASF's corporate outreach on behalf of farmed fishes and chickens is particularly promising, given the large number of animals killed and the neglectedness of advocacy on their behalf.",J.why_recommended="ASF's work seems highly effective at increasing the availability of animal-free products, improving farmed animal welfare standards, and strengthening the capacity of the movement. We are hopeful that their strategy and skills will lead to meaningful progress in Poland and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe, areas with relatively young animal advocacy movements.
