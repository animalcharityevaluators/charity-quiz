				<h4>How this works</h4>
				<p>Use the text boxes in the right sidebar to change the weights assigned to our recommended charities. Once you upload a CSV file of user or staff quiz answers, you can see how charities are performing. Blue text indicates scores that are too low, and red text scores that are too high: try to tweak weights so that the text in the right sidebar is black (indicating it meets your chosen accuracy standard, 10% to begin with). Remember, you still need to copy the array of charity weights into the charity quiz's Javascript files.</p>
				<p>The automatic weighting can take a pretty long time per round, up to a minute or so: if your browser indicates the tab is nonresponsive, just choose to let it keep running and it will resolve eventually. If the initial results are very uneven, doing some manual weighting yourself before trying the automatic version may save time. If the automatic weighter is not able to progress, it is probably stuck in a loop. You can try doing some manual weighting to achieve more accuracy, or lowering the desired margin of error to encourage the automatic weighter to try smaller changes. Especially with small samples of answers, however, there are limits to how low of a margin of error is attainable. The automatic weighter does decrease the desired margin of error itself to try to keep improving.</p>
				<p>In 2021 we set the ratio of Top Charity : Standout Charity scores to 11.3 : 6.1 (1.852) in order to match the most recent allocation to the <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charity-fund/">Recommended Charity Fund</a>.</p>
				<p>If initial results of quiz users have not been collected, there are a few options in order to get data to weight with:</p>
				<ul><li>Adapt answers from previous years. This option is ideal if practical, which it may be when changes to the evaluation proces (and consequently changes to the quiz) are relatively minor from one year two another.
					<li>Ask various staff members to take the quiz.
					<li>Take the updated quiz role-playing as a "focus group member" where you adopt some particular outlook an animal advocate might have.
					<li>Submit randomized answers using the tool above.
					<li>Use a combination of these appproaches (e.g. 10 staff answers, each repeated 4x, 50 randomized answers, 10 "focus group" answers.)
				</ul>
				<p>Note that the title of the sheet in the <i>Charity Quiz Responses</i> spreadsheet (currently <i>Quiz Responses (2021)</i> is specified in the App Script program that controls results submission; ACE staff members can find this program at <a href="https://script.google.com/">script.google.com</a>.</p>
